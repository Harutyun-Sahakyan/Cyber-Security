# Cyber Security / Penetration Testing Portfolio

This repository documents my hands-on work in penetration testing, Linux privilege escalation, red team tactics, and attack automation.  
All projects come from real labs, CTF challenges, or my own attack environments.

## 🔹 Web Pentesting
SQL Injection, XSS, authentication bypasses, directory enumeration, and PortSwigger labs.

## 🔹 Network Attacks & Enumeration
Nmap, SSH, SMB, FTP, DNS, and misconfiguration exploitation.

## 🔹 Linux Privilege Escalation
SUID binaries, capabilities, PATH hijacking, cron jobs, and weak permissions.

## 🔹 Red Team Basics
Initial access, persistence on Linux systems, payload obfuscation, simple C2 setup, and post-exploitation.

## 🔹 Automation Scripts
Python and Bash tools I built for recon, scanning, exploitation, and enumeration.

More labs and writeups coming as I progress in penetration testing and red teaming.
